## Dashboard using dash and plotly on Jupyter Notebook
1) Import the dataset and put it in the same file than the .ipynb file.
2) Don't forget to remove comments ("#") for the first case to be sure to install every libraries we will need to import for the visualization.
3) I created a lot of functions to have a dash code more understandable. I use only one dash so you can execute the whole program and click on the link create when app.run_server() is called.
